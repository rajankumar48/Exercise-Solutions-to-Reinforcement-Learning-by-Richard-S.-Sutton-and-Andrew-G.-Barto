# Exercise 2.4

### If the step-size parameters, α<sub>n</sub> are not constant, then the estimate Q<sub>n</sub> is a weighted average of previously received rewards with a weighting different from that given by (2.6). What is the weighting on each prior reward for the general case, analogous to (2.6), in terms of the sequence of step-size parameters?

Let's α<sub>n</sub> be step size parameter for step n.

# Exercise 2.6

### *Mysterious Spikes* The results shown in Figure 2.3 should be quite reliable because they are averages over 2000 individual, randomly chosen 10-armed bandits tasks. Why, then, are there oscillations and spikes in the early part of the curve for the optimistic method? In other words, what might make this method perform particularly better or worse, on average, on particular early steps?

In initial steps, the action-value estimates Q are higher than real expected value q*, which allows agent to explore. It means, whichever actions are selected, the rewards are less than the starting estimates and agents switches to other actions, being disappointed every time till it tries all possible actions once. If  we notice closely in the figure 2.3, it is approximately 10%, i.e. equal probability of selection of each arm. At this point (after 10 steps), it learns the best action to select to receive maximum reward, and it resulted as spike in figure 2.3. However, action value estimates is still higher than real expected value and disappoints agent further which prompt it to explore again. This is repeated till action value estimates become closer to expected value.

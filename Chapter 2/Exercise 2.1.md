# Exercise 2.1

### In ε-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and ε = 0.5, what is the probability that the greedy action is selected?

Probability of the greedy action to be selected, p(a) = (1 - ε) + ε * (probability of random action)

Since, there are only two possible actions, probability of random action = 0.5

Therefore, p(a) = 0.5 + 05 * 0.5 = 0.75

# Exercise 2.5

### *(Programming)* Design and conduct an experiment to demonstrate the difficulties that sample-average methods have for non-stationary problems. Use a modified version of the 10-armed testbed in which all the q*(a) start out equal and then take independent random walks (say by adding a normally distributed increment with mean zero and standard deviation 0.01 to all the q*(a) on each step. Prepare plots like Figure 2.2 for an action-value method using sample averages, incrementally computed, and another action-value method using a constant step-size parameter, α = 0.1. Use ε = 0.1 and longer runs, say of 10,000 steps.
